## History

There have been periods of time in my life when I've gone on a temporary low carb/cyclical ketogenic diet in order to lose weight.  A variety of factors made this difficult:

* I love food
* Especially carby food
* I don't always have time in my life to cook
* I know that my body will actually lose fat on a low carb diet.

What I had going in my favor is that I work in downtown Los Angeles, surrounded by a variety of delicious food accessible by convenient and frequent 50 cent buses.  Of all the reasons to break diet, I decided that not being able to think of where to eat is a stupid one.  Thus, I thought to create a list of low carb options in DTLA.
